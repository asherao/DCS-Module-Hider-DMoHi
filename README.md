# DCS-Module-Hider-DMoHi

Welcome to DCS Module Hider (DMoHi) v1. This program will enable you to select which aircraft you want to display or hide on the main menu of DCS and in what order. It works for modules you have purchased, modules you have not purchased, and selected mods. This program, creates, and deletes files on your computer. If you are not comfortable with that, do not this utility. 
1. Click and drag the module names above "--MODULES ABOVE WILL BE SHOWN IN ORDER--". They will be displayed in the same order. Alternatively, you can also drag the seperator if you like.

2. Select your DCS Installation folder. It is likely located at ‘C:\Program Files\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World’ (or DCS World OpenBeta).

3. Click the ‘Confirm and Export’ button. The utility will export a new ‘pluginsEnabled.lua’ to the chosen location. The utility will also create a folder and file where you ran the utility. This file contains the location of ‘pluginsEnabled.lua´ so you won’t have to search for it next time you use the utility.

4. If you want to restore all modules please use the DCS repair utility.

That’s it! Thank you for using DMoHi! If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or would just like to say “Thanks”, feel free to contact me via Discord: Bailey#6230.

Enjoy!
