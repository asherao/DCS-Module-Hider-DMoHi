# DCS-Module-Hider-DMoHi

Welcome to DCS Module Hider (DMoHi) v1. This program will enable you to select which aircraft you want to display or hide on the main menu of DCS (as well as the rest of DCS). It works for modules you have purchased, modules you have not purchased, and selected mods. This program, creates, and deletes files on your computer. If you are not comfortable with that, do not this utility. 
1. Check the modules that you want to use and view in the DCS main menu. (I typically check modules I own).

2. Select your DCS Saved Games Config folder. It is likely located at ‘C:\\Users\\YOURNAME\\SavedGames\\DCS.openbeta\\Config’.

3. Click the ‘Confirm and Export’ button. The utility will export a new ‘pluginsEnabled.lua’ to the chosen location. The utility will also create a folder and file where you ran the utility. This file contains the location of ‘pluginsEnabled.lua´ so you won’t have to search for it next time you use the utility.

4. If you want to unhide all modules in DCS press the ‘Unhide all modules’ button. Doing this will delete ‘pluginsEnabled.lua’ and sets the visible DCS modules to default.

That’s it! Thank you for using DMoHi! If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or would just like to say “Thanks”, feel free to contact me via Discord: Bailey#6230.
